Property of Henk Hsiung and Paolo Caraos



Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android SDK v23
- Android Build Tools v23.0.2
- Android Support Repository


Getting Started
---------------

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
"gradle build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.


How-to-Play
---------------
The user begins at the Main Menu Screen where he is prompted to either login with an existing username or register a new username. Then, the application takes him to google maps, where he can see his location on the map, and his biome, or different regions where different types of pokemon exist. The user can also see his own profile username, points, and pokemon caught on this screen. Once the user is satisfied with his location, the application takes him to the camera screen, where he can take a photo, in which a pokemon filter will appear on the photo. In order to capture the pokemon, the user must save this image along with the pokemon filter. By capturing pokemon, the user's score increases.

Notes
---------------
The application allows for more pokemon to be added into different regions if the developer wishes.
Both the pictures and the user profile information is stored in an external storage folder named Geocache.
The user profile is stored as .txt but is not mean't to be readable
